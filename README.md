# Sample code - Topology Graph Processor
Min Weight Topology Computation RPC Service
Calculates all pair Min Weight Topology from a source
Weights for all the edges of a node is placed in a Min Heap Tree (conceptual tree: weights are in an array) for O(logE) 
extraction of Min weight (recursive)
Minimum Spanning Tree or Shortest path Tree
Shortest ECMP paths
ECMP Next Hops from a source to a destination (recursive)
