# Min Weight Topology Computation RPC Service
#	Calculates all pair Min Weight Topology from a source,
# Weights for all the edges of a node is placed in a Min Heap Tree (conceptual tree: weights are in an array) for O(logE) 
# extraction of Min weight (recursive),
#	Minimum Spanning Tree or Shortest path Tree,
#	Shortest ECMP paths
#	ECMP Next Hops from a source to a destination (recursive)
